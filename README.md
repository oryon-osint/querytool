## **About**
     
QueryTool is a specialized OSINT framework integrated within Google Sheets, aimed at simplifying the process of generating queries for various search engines to obtain specific results. Designed as an initial step in reconnaissance, QueryTool enables users to conduct sophisticated searches for terms, usernames, email addresses, files, and more. It primarily comprises a set of resources facilitating direct access to search outcomes, supporting the cyber investigation process with a subjective collection of tools and services.

The spreadsheet is categorized into four sections, each containing useful search tools:

1. **Recon & SOCMINT**
   - Search engines for general research purposes and tools tailored for social media search.

2. **Virtual HUMINT**
   - Tools for gathering and analyzing information about individuals, including wallets and cryptocurrency transaction analysis.

3. **Web & Domain**
   - Resources for domain and website reconnaissance.

4. **Dark Web Search**
   - Search engines for the Tor network, facilitating exploration and investigation of dark web content.

## **Usage**

1. Sign in to your Google account and navigate to the QueryTool spreadsheet.
2. Select **File** > **Make a copy** to create an editable version for your personal use.
3. Proceed to the chosen sheet and input the relevant data. It is not mandatory to fill in all fields; provide the information available to you and review the generated links in the designated area.
4. For searching specific phrases, replace spaces with dots to maintain the hyperlink functionality without impacting search results.
5. **Important:** Do not request access to the original tool. Always make a copy for personal use.
